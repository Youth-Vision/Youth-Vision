                Everyone uses Social Media almost everyday and know with
                the pandemic social media is used even more. Anyway, not every
                content is appropiate for all the teenager that use these
                apps, so we have to take actions as followers of Christ
                and fight against these innapropiate content with Christ centered content.
                Instead of harming or influencing others to take attitudes that
                don't honor God. With the content that we upload, help others
                to know how much Christ loves each one of us and what
                He did for us.
            </p>
            <p class="content-p2">
                That is why we have an account on the most used Social Apps and
                we upload content that is different from the rest and that
                inspires others to follow God and his Holly Word. <br>

            <p class="content-p3">
                Sharing posts like the one above is an effective way to share verses to others and remember the commandments the Lord gave us.
                We see all kind of posts on social media everyday and we tend to remember them even when we are not using our phones or computers.
                When we see Christian Centered posts with sriptures or testimonies we remember them too. Knowing verses makes us grow in our relationship with God, having them
                in mind help us while fighting temptation. Just giving it a like or share it will make you see more posts like this ones and you'll stop looking or listening
                unapropiate posts. <br>
                These type of things will help you grow spiritually, and encourage you to do things that honor God and follow His Word.
            </p>
            <p class="Verse2">
                "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. <br> If any man love the world,<br>the love of the Father is not
                in him"
            </p>

                If you are interested in how to help fighting against fashion that displease God, ask yourself:
                Why don't I start know? Creating a profile is easy and fast, and you will help in spreading the word of the Lord
                that is one of his commandments but, the most important of all is that you will be giving Him honor and obeying his
                Word. It is not neccesary to make an account and start uploading verses, testimonies etc., just by little action
